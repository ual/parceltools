Introduction
============

This package contains tools for the OpenParcelMap (OPM).  OpenParcelMap is a
system built from OpenStreetMap components to contain parcel data.  You can see
more at http://opm.ual.berkeley.edu.  You can also read more about it on [the
blog] (http://http://openparceldata.wordpress.com/).

NOTE: There is no consensus on whether parcel boundaries and other data belong
in the main OpenStreetMap repository.  These tools are used to upload data to
the OpenParcelMap at opm.ual.berkeley.edu.  Be sure that you do not
accidentally point your tools at OpenStreetMap when working with parcel data.
